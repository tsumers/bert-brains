10,15.089998999999999,16.310000000000002,10,I began my illustrious,4.0,,
11,16.33,17.929999,11,career in journalism,3.0,1.0,10.0
12,18.469998999999998,19.39,12,in the Bronx where,4.0,1.0,11.0
13,19.39,20.89,13,I toiled as a hard,5.0,1.0,12.0
14,20.89,22.360000000000007,14,boiled reporter for the,4.0,1.0,13.0
15,22.36,22.77,15,Ram,1.0,1.0,14.0
16,23.93,25.39,16,the student newspaper at,4.0,1.0,15.0
17,25.39,26.41,17,Fordham University,2.0,1.0,16.0
18,27.07,28.43,18,And one day I’m walking toward the campus,8.0,1.0,17.0
19,28.429999,29.69,19,center and out comes the,5.0,1.0,18.0
20,29.69,31.0,20,elusive Dean,2.0,1.0,19.0
21,31.0,32.910000000000004,21,McGowan architect of,3.0,1.0,20.0
22,32.91,34.21,22,a policy to,3.0,1.0,21.0
23,34.209999,35.19000000000001,23,replace Fordham’s,2.0,1.0,22.0
24,35.199999,37.36,24,traditionally working to middle,4.0,1.0,23.0
25,37.369999,38.28,25,class students,2.0,1.0,24.0
26,38.74,40.04,26,with wealthier more,3.0,1.0,25.0
27,40.04,41.26,27,prestigious ones,2.0,1.0,26.0
28,42.21,43.37,28,So I whip out my notebook and I,8.0,1.0,27.0
29,43.37,44.97,29,go up to him and I say Dean McGowan,9.0,1.0,28.0
30,45.42,46.249999,30,is it true that,4.0,1.0,29.0
31,46.25,47.72,31,Fordham University plans to raise,5.0,1.0,30.0
32,47.719999,49.17,32,tuition substantially above the,4.0,1.0,31.0
33,49.17,50.92,33,inflation rate and if so,5.0,1.0,32.0
34,51.16,52.44999900000001,34,wouldn’t that be a betrayal of its,7.0,1.0,33.0
35,52.459999,52.979999,35,mission,1.0,1.0,34.0
36,54.719999,54.95,36,And he,2.0,1.0,35.0
37,54.95,56.56,37,stops and looks at me,5.0,1.0,36.0
38,57.1,57.9,38,and he says,3.0,1.0,37.0
39,58.66,59.6,39,Listen up punk,3.0,1.0,38.0
40,59.82,60.88,40,And right then there’s a,5.0,1.0,39.0
41,60.9,62.8,41,blur in the corner of my eye which,8.0,1.0,40.0
42,62.8,64.29,42,becomes this figure,3.0,1.0,41.0
43,64.559999,65.9,43,holding a cream pie which,5.0,1.0,42.0
44,65.91,67.079999,44,becomes the guy,3.0,1.0,43.0
45,67.299999,68.64,45,standing next to me,4.0,1.0,44.0
46,69.03999999999999,70.11,46,mashing a cream,3.0,1.0,45.0
47,70.109999,71.469999,47,pie into Dean McGowan’s,4.0,1.0,46.0
48,71.48,72.14,48,face,1.0,1.0,47.0
49,73.6,74.91,49,And then runs away,4.0,1.0,48.0
51,77.48,77.74,51,And the,2.0,2.0,49.0
52,77.74,79.2,52,Dean is,2.0,1.0,51.0
53,79.2,80.09,53,covered with cream,3.0,1.0,52.0
54,82.3,82.49,54,So,1.0,1.0,53.0
55,82.49,83.42,55,I give him a moment,5.0,1.0,54.0
57,85.63,86.92,57,and then I say Dean McGowan would you,8.0,2.0,55.0
58,86.92,88.24000000000002,58,care to comment on this latest,6.0,1.0,57.0
59,88.24,88.64,59,attack And,2.0,1.0,58.0
61,91.98,92.48,61,the Dean says,3.0,2.0,59.0
62,92.48,94.05,62,Yes I would care to,5.0,1.0,61.0
63,94.05,95.68,63,comment Fuck,2.0,1.0,62.0
64,95.73,96.13,64,you,1.0,1.0,63.0
65,98.13,98.94,65,So I race back,4.0,1.0,64.0
66,98.94,100.47,66,to the newsroom with my scoop,6.0,1.0,65.0
67,101.32,101.839999,67,and I find the,4.0,1.0,66.0
68,101.84,103.4,68,editor Jim Dwyer who’s a,5.0,1.0,67.0
69,103.4,104.91,69,senior and he will,4.0,1.0,68.0
70,104.91,106.44,70,go on to win a Pulitzer Prize that,8.0,1.0,69.0
71,106.440001,106.93,71,is true,2.0,1.0,70.0
72,108.11999899999999,109.33,72,and he’s a big guy I,6.0,1.0,71.0
73,109.36999899999999,110.81,73,pitch him my story I tell him what I’ve,9.0,1.0,72.0
74,110.81,112.11,74,seen and he,3.0,1.0,73.0
75,112.12,113.58,75,says Dean,2.0,1.0,74.0
76,113.58,115.45,76,McGowan that guy’s,3.0,1.0,75.0
77,115.45,116.75,77,a dick Write it up,5.0,1.0,76.0
78,118.04,118.34,78,So I’m,2.0,1.0,77.0
79,118.349999,119.84,79,banging out my story and I know it’s,8.0,1.0,78.0
80,119.84,121.32,80,good and then I start,5.0,1.0,79.0
81,121.4,121.96,81,to make it,3.0,1.0,80.0
82,122.839999,123.289999,82,better,1.0,1.0,81.0
84,126.109999,127.28,84,by adding an element,4.0,2.0,82.0
85,127.4,128.09,85,of embellishment,2.0,1.0,84.0
86,129.24,130.16,86,Reporters call,2.0,1.0,85.0
87,130.16,131.78,87,this making,2.0,1.0,86.0
88,131.78,132.47000000000003,88,shit up,2.0,1.0,87.0
90,135.5,135.81,90,And they,2.0,2.0,88.0
91,135.809999,137.96,91,recommend against crossing that,4.0,1.0,90.0
92,137.96,138.35,92,line,1.0,1.0,91.0
93,139.95,140.669999,93,But I had just,4.0,1.0,92.0
94,140.67,142.049999,94,seen the line,3.0,1.0,93.0
95,142.09,143.699999,95,crossed between a high powered,5.0,1.0,94.0
96,143.709999,145.19,96,dean and assault with a,5.0,1.0,95.0
97,145.19,146.98,97,pastry and,2.0,1.0,96.0
98,146.98,147.86,98,I kind of liked it,5.0,1.0,97.0
99,148.77,149.93,99,So the first I did,5.0,1.0,98.0
100,150.36,151.29000000000005,100,was I gave the figure a,6.0,1.0,99.0
101,151.29,152.82000000000005,101,name I called him Pie,5.0,1.0,100.0
102,152.849999,154.37,102,Man capital P capital,4.0,1.0,101.0
103,154.389999,155.72,103,M And I,3.0,1.0,102.0
104,155.719999,157.209999,104,described him as a cape wearing,6.0,1.0,103.0
105,157.21,158.38,105,masked avenger,2.0,1.0,104.0
106,159.889999,160.479999,106,Though in fact he’d,4.0,1.0,105.0
107,160.48,161.149999,107,been capeless,2.0,1.0,106.0
108,162.00999900000005,163.05,108,And said that as he fled the,7.0,1.0,107.0
109,163.05,164.70000000000005,109,scene he clicked his,4.0,1.0,108.0
110,164.71,166.08999999999997,110,heels in rakish glee,4.0,1.0,109.0
112,169.17,169.37,112,And I,2.0,2.0,110.0
113,169.38,170.44,113,gave him a catchphrase,4.0,1.0,112.0
114,171.639999,172.289999,114,in Latin,2.0,1.0,113.0
117,175.67,176.83,117,I said that he cried out,6.0,3.0,114.0
118,177.95000000000005,178.24,118,Ego sum,2.0,1.0,117.0
119,178.56,179.13000000000005,119,non an,2.0,1.0,118.0
120,179.690001,180.340001,120,bestia,1.0,1.0,119.0
121,181.73,182.85,121,which means I,3.0,1.0,120.0
122,182.97,184.0,122,am not an,3.0,1.0,121.0
123,184.02,184.95,123,animal,1.0,1.0,122.0
124,186.11,187.36,124,Which makes no,3.0,1.0,123.0
125,187.36,187.83,125,sense,1.0,1.0,124.0
126,189.84,190.29999899999999,126,I needed,2.0,1.0,125.0
127,190.3,191.73,127,something I’m,2.0,1.0,126.0

130,195.45,196.449999,130,So I finish my story,5.0,1.0,129.0
131,196.609999,197.92,131,and I hand it to Dwyer and he,8.0,1.0,130.0
132,197.92,198.78,132,reads and he says,4.0,1.0,131.0

139,209.5,209.96,139,A few days,3.0,1.0,138.0
140,209.96,210.96999900000003,140,later I get a letter,5.0,1.0,139.0
